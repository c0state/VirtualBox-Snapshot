VirtualBox script to take snapshots of all guests on a given system and/or prune snapshots on given system

* Works by calling vboxmanage script and parsing output
* Snapshots are taken of all guests on the system
* Pruning is specified by --prune_snapshots option which takes the number of snapshots to keep
  (ie: --prune_snapshots 10 means keep only 10 snapshots per guest, deleting any older ones)
* Status is logged to stdout and can optionally be logged to an email address via BufferedSMTPHandler
* Snapshots are named "yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss"
  Optionally, a tag suffix can be applied (specified by --tag option) to 
  indicate that the snapshot was taken with this script
  (eg: "yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss tag")
